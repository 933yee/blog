### Process Concept
- An operating system concurrently executes a variety of programs (e.g. Web broswer, text editor, etc)
  - Program
    - passive entity
    - **binary stored in disk**
  - Process
    - active entity
    - **a program in execution in memory**
- A process includes  
  - Code segment (text section)
    - 程式碼
    - 不是一般的 code，是 compile 好的 instructions
  - Data section
    - global variables
  - Stack
    - temporary local variables and functions
    - 自動 deallocate
  - Heap
    - dynamic allocated variables or classes
    - malloc()
    - 不會自動 deallocate
  - Current activity (**program counter**, register contents)
    - 目前執行到 code 的哪一行
    - context switch 後，要把 registers 裡面的狀態存起來
  - A set of associated **resources** (e.g. open file handlers)
    - resources hardware control

#### Process in memory
```img

```

#### Thread
- A.k.a **lightweight process**
- 可以共用 memory 空間
- basic unit of CPU utilization
  - process 切成一個或多個 thread
- All threads **belonging to the same process** share
  - **code** section, **data** section and **OS resources** (e.g. open files and signals)
- But each thread has its own
  - **thread ID**, **program counter**, **register set** and a **stack**
- 因為有自己的 local variable，彼此可以用 global variable 溝通
```img
Thread.png
```

#### Process State
- States
  - **New**: the process is being created
    - program load 到 memory
    - 如果 memory 不夠，就會失敗
  - **Ready**: the process is in the memory waiting to be assigned to a processor
    - program in queue，準備競爭 CPU 資源
  - **Running**: instructions are being executed by CPU
  - **Waiting**: the process is waiting for events to occur
    - 暫時不需要使用 CPU 的時候，像是 IO
  - **Terminated**: the process has finished execution

#### Diagram of Process State
- Only one process is **running** on any processor at any instant
- However, many processes may be **ready** or **waiting**
```img
process-state-diagram.png
```
- admitted
  - memory 不夠或是沒有 permission，就無法執行
- interrupt
  - 通常是 timer 被 fire 出來，像是 time-sharing-system 超過某 minisecond，就會 running process switch 給 OS scheduler
- I/O or event wait
  - 做了 I/O 或 sleep，process 會進入 waiting queue
- I/O or event completion
  - I/O 或 sleep 結束，process 會進入 ready queue，才有機會再次被執行

#### Process Control Block (PCB)
- Information associated with each process
- also called **task control block**
- **存在 kernel 自己的 memory 裡面**
- 使用者建立 process，OS 幫使用者建立時自己會建立 PCB 做管理
##### Structure
- Pointer
  - 指到在 queue 裡面的下一個 PCB
- Process state
  - 記錄狀態，像是現在是在 waiting queue 還是 ready queue 
- Program counter
  - 是 OS 幫 process 記的，使用者或是 process 的 memory space 裡面是沒有的
- CPU registers
- CPU scheduling information
  - e.g. priority
- Memory-management information
  - e.g. base/limit register
    - 只有在這個程式執行的時候才會 load 到 hardware，因為 hardware 的 register 只有兩三個
- I/O status information
  - 記錄現在是在做哪個 I/O device 的 I/O，因為不同 I/O device 有不同的 waiting queue
- Accounting information
  - 開了多少個 file

#### Context switch
- Kernel saves the state of the old process and loads the saved state for the new process
- Contexe-switch time is purely **overhead**
- Switch time (about 1 ~ 1000 ms) depends on
  - memory speed, number of registers
  - existence of special intructions
    - a single instruction to save/load all registers
  - hardware support
    - **multiple sets of registers** 
    - CPU 原本只有一個 set，改成有多個 register set，可以一次記多個程式的狀態在 hardware register，減少 memeory 的 access
- instruction for store/load multiple registers
  - ARM instructions load, store, push, pop multiple regs
    - LDM {r2, lr}  load multiple
    - STM {r2, lr}  store multiple
    - PUSH {r0, r4-r7}
    - POP {r0, r10, pc}
- Register windows
  - Sun SPARC ISA uses sliding register windows
  - 8051 has four register banks
```img

### Process Scheduling

<br>

- **Multiprogramming**
  - CPU runs process at all times to maxmize CPU utilization
- **Time sharing**
  - switch CPU frequently such that users can interact with each program while it is running
- Processes will have to wait until the CPU is free and can be rescheduled
- Processes migrate between the various queues
  - Job queue (New State)
    - set of **all processes** in the system
  - Ready queue (Ready State)
    - set of all processes residing in main memory, **ready and waiting to execute**
  - Device queue (Wait State)
    - set of processes **waiting for an I/O device**

```img
process-scheduling-diagram.png
```
- time slice expired
  - timer fired
- fork a child
  - create a child process and execute it first, put parent process into waiting queue
- wait for interrupt
  - sleep()

#### Schedulers
- Short-term scheduler (**CPU scheduler**) - selects which process should be executed and **allocated CPU (Ready state -> Running state)**
- Long-term scheduler (**job scheduler**) - selects which processes should be **loaded into memory** and brought into the ready queue **(New state -> Ready state)**
- Medium-term scheduler - selects which processes should be **swapped in/out memory (Ready state -> Waiting state)** 
  - 把 memory 的 process swap 回 disk，以 memory content 的形式儲存，而不是檔案形式
```img
Schedulers.png
```
##### Long-Term Scheduler
- Control **degree of multiprogramming**
  - memory 裡面有多少 process
  - low degree
    - CPU idle，像是 batch 的 degree = 1
  - high degree
    - thrashing，太多 process 爭搶有限的 memory，會不斷 swapping
- Select a **good mix of CPU-bound & I/O-bound processes** to increase system overall performance
  - 如果都是 CPU-bound，I/O 做不了
  - 如果都是 I/O-bound，I/O 太慢，CPU 會 idle
- UNIX/NT no long-term scheduler
  - created processes placed in memory for shor-term scheduler
  - memory 夠大，把 process 都 load 到裡面

##### Short-Term Scheduler
- Execute quite frequently (e.g. once per 100 ms)
- system call, interrupt
- Must be efficient
  - if 10 ms for picking a job, 100 ms for such a pick, overhead = 10/110 = 9%

##### Medium-Term Scheduler
- swap out
  - removing processes from memory to reduce the degree of multiprogramming
- swap in
  - reintroducing swap-out processes into memory
- improve process mix, free up memory
- Most modern OS doesn't have medium-term scheduler because having sufficient phtsical memory or using virtual memory

<br>

### Operations on Processes

<br>

#### Tree of Processes
- Each process is identified by a **unique** processor identifier (**pid**)
- 一定是樹狀的

#### Process Creation
- Resource sharing
  - Parent and child processes share **all** resources
  - Child process shares **subset** of parent's resources
  - Parent and child share **no** resources
- Two possibilities of execution
  - Parent and childern **execute concurrently** 
    - 看 OS 決定哪個先執行
  - Parent **waits until children terminate**
- Two possibilities of address space
  - **Child duplicate of parent**, communication via sharing variables
  - **Child has a program loaded into it**, communication via message passing

#### UNIX/LINUX Process Creation
- **fork** system call
  - Create a new (child) process
  - The new process **duplicates the address space** of its parent
  - Child & Parent **execute concurrently** after fork
  - Child: return value of fork is 0
  - Parent: return value of fork is PID of the child process
    - 可以用來區分是 parent 還是 child

- **exec** system call
  - **replaces** process itself with specified program (in args)
  - **restart** process
  - **Load a new binary file** into memory - **destroying the old code**
  - replace 掉原本的 code segment
  - 清空 heap、stack
  - program counter 設成 0
  - return value
    - if successful, exec() does not return, beacuse it runs the new program
    - but if error (e.g., program not found) then returns **-1** with error code in a global variable **errno**
  - API variants of exec
    - execlp(), execl(), execle(): path, arg0, arg1, ..., NULL
    - execv(), execvp(): path, argv[]
    - execvP(), file, searchpath, argv[]

- **wait** system call
  - The parent waits for **one of its child processes** to complete
  - get the child's return status (exit code) **pid = wait(&status);**
  - OS won't release (recycle) child pid and table enrty till parent calls **wait()**

- Memory space of fork():
  - Old implementation: A's child is an **exact copy** of parent
  - Current implementation: use **copy-on-write** techinique to store **differences in A's child address space**
    - runtime 時，如果動到原本 memory 的值，只 copy 會被改掉的部分，ex: program counter, variables
    - 不影響執行的，直接用 pointer 存
    - 省掉 memory 不必要的空間使用
```img
process-creation.png
```

#### UNIX/LINUX example
```c
include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
  int A;
  /* fork another process */
  A = fork();
  if (A == 0) { /* child process */
    printf(“this is from child process\n”);
    execlp(“/bin/ls”, “ls”, NULL);
  } else { /* parent process */
    printf(“this is from parent process\n”);
    int pid = wait(&status);
    printf(“Child %d completes”, pid);
  }
  printf(“process ends %d\n”, A);
}
// output:
// this is from child process
// this is from parent process 第一二行順序不一定，因為是 concurrent
// a.out hello.c readme.txt
// Child 32185 completes
// process ends 32185
```

#### Process Termination
- Terminate when the last statement is executed or **exit()** is call
  - All resources of the process, including physical & virtual memory, open files, I/O buffers are **deallocated by the OS**
- Parent may terminate execution of children processes by specifying its PID (**abort**)
  - child has executed allocated resources
  - task assigned to child is no longer required
- Cascading termination
  - killing (exiting) parent -> killing (exiting) all is children
  - ex: ctrl + c 可以結束某個程式，因為 console 是上層的 process
- zombie process
  - dead child process that died before its parent calls wait()
  - zombie pid released when parent calls wait()
- Orphan process
  - if you don't have cascaded termination
  - a child process (alive) whose parent died 
  - Solution: an ancestor process could call wait() to collect orphans
  - Root process: init(tradition Unix) or systemd(Linux)

<br>

### Interprocess Communication (IPC)

<br>

- a set of methods for the exchange of data among multiple threads in one or more processes
- 在 OS 中通常 process 和 thread 沒有做區分，溝通的機制統稱 IPC
- Independent process
  - cannot affect or be affected by other processes
- Cooperating process
  - otherwise
- Purposes
  - information sharing
  - computation speedup (平行程式)
  - convenience
  - modularity


#### Communication methods
##### Shared memory
- 用 pointer 去 access shared memory
- Require more careful **user synchronization**
- Implemented by memory access: faster speed
- **Use memory address to access data**
##### Message passing
- No conflict: **more efficient for small data**
- **Use send/recv message**
- Implemented by **system call**: slow speed

##### Sockets
- A network connection identified by **IP & port**
  - port 就是連到 process
- Exchange **unstructured stream of bytes**
  - 因為不知道傳的資料型態是甚麼，兩邊要事先知道彼此在傳什麼型態
  
##### Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
- 許多大型的分散式系統用這個方法
- 兩台電腦用 function call 溝通
- Cause a **procedure** to execute in another address space
- Parameters and return values are passed by message
```img
RPC.png
```

#### Shared Memory
- Establishing a region of shared memory
  - Typically, a shared memory region resides in the address space of the process creating the shared memory segment
  - Participating processes **must agree to remove memory access constraint** from OS
    - 叫 OS 幫忙 create，剩下的使用者要自己實作
- Determining the form of the data and the location
- Ensuring data are not written simultaneously by processes
- no need for data copying
- does not work across machines
- need to deterimine the form of data and location
  - text or binary, struct, semantics

- Consumer & Producer Problem  
  - **Producer process** produces information that is consumed by a **Consumer process**
  - Buffer as a circular array with size B
    - next free: **in**
    - first available: **out**
    - empty: **in = out**
    - full: **(in + 1) % B = out**
  - The solution allows at most (B - 1) items in the buffer
    - otherwise we cannot tell the buffer is empty or full

```c
/*producer*/
while (1) {
while (((in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE) == out); //wait if buffer is full
  buffer[in] = nextProduced;
  in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
}
/*consumer*/
while (1) {
  while (in == out); //wait if buffer is empty
  nextConsumed = buffer[out];
  out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
}
```

#### Message-Passing System
- 比較慢，但是比較好寫
- Mechanism for processes to **communicate** and **synchronize** their actions
- IPC facility provides two operations
  - **Send(message)** - message size fixed or variable
  - **Receive(message)**
- Message system - processes communicate **without resorting to shared variables**
- To communicate, processes need to 
  - Establish a **communication link**
  - Exchange a message via **send/receive**

#### Implementation of communication link
- physical
  - shared memory, hardware bus, network
- logical (logical properties)
  - **Direct or indirect communication** 
    - 單向傳輸、雙向傳輸
  - **Blocking or non-blocking**
    - 行為完全做完才會 return、做到一半就回傳
  - Symmetric or asymmetric communication
  - Automatic or explicit buffering
  - Send by copy or send by reference
  - Fixed-sized or variable-sized message

##### Direct communication
- Processes must **name each other explicitly**
  - Send(P, message)
    - send a message to proccess P
  - Receive(Q, message)
    - receive a message from process Q
- Properties of communication link
  - Links are **established automatically**
  - **One-to-One** relationship between links and processes
  - The link may be unidirectional, but is usually bi-directional
    - 通常是單向

- Consumer & Producer Problem  
  - **limited modularity**
    - if the **name** of a process is **changed**, all old names should be found
```c
/*producer*/
while (1) {
  send (consumer, nextProduced);
}
/*consumer*/
while (1) {
  receive (producer, nextConsumed);
}
```

##### Indirect communication
- sender、receiver 不知道對方是誰
- 有同步化問題，可能同時有很多人要 receive message
  - 
- Messages are directed and received from **mailboxes** (also refered to as ports)
  - **Each mailbox has a unique ID**
  - Processes can communicate if they share a mailbox
  - Send(A, message)
    - send a message to mailbox A
  - Receive(A, message)
    - receive a message from mailbox A
- Properties of communication link
  - Link established only **if processes share a common mailbox**
  - **Many-to-many** relationship between links and processes
    - 可以很多人 receive 同一個 mailbox 的 message
  - Link may be unidirectional or bi-directional
  - Mailbox can be owned either by OS or processes

##### Process symmetry
- symmetric
  - sender and receiver name each other
  - send(P, msg) ... receive(Q, &buf)
- asymmetric
  - sender names the target process to send to
  - receiver receives from ANY process and gets sender ID


##### Synchronization
- Message passing may be either **blocking** (synchronous) or **noon-blocking** (asynchronization)
  - Blocking send
    - sender is blocked until the messsage is receive by receiver or by the mailbox
  - Nonblocking send
    - sender sends the message and resumes operation
  - Blocking receive
    - receiver is blocked until message is available
  - Nonblocking receive
    - receiver receives a valid message or a null
- Buffer implementation
  - 處理 nonblocking
  - Zero capacity
    - blocking send/receive
  - Bounded capacity
    - if full, sender will be blocked
  - Unbounded capacity
    - sender never blocks, receiver blocks only if buffer empty

#### Sockets
- A socket is identified by a concatention if **IP address** and **port number**
- Communication consists between **pair of sockets**
- Use 127.0.0.1 to refer itself
```img
sockets.png
```
- 通常為了讓多個 receiver，所以 connect() 會 create thread，且這個 thread 是 nonblocking

#### Remote Precedure Calls (RPC)
- RPC abstracts procedure calls between processes **on networked systems**
  - allows programs to call procedures located on other machines and other processes
- **Stubs**
  - client side proxy for the actual procedure on server
- **marshaling** and **demarshaling**
  - pack parameters into a message/ unpack parameters
```img
stubs.png
```

##### Client and Server Stubs
- Client Stub
  - Packs parameters into a message (**parameter marshaling**)
    - 可以跨電腦，不管作業系統不同或是其他設定不同(endian、int...)
  - Calls OS to send directly to the server
  - Waits for result-return from the server
- Server stub
  - Receives a call from a client
  - Calls the corresponding **procedure**
  - Unpacks the parameters
  - Returns results to the caller
```img
RPC2.png
```

##### RPC Problems
- Data representation
  - integer, floating point
    - char encoding, ASCII
    - one's complement, 2's complement
    - little endian, big endian
    - floating-point numbers, sizes
  - Solution
    - external data representation (XDR)
- Different address spaces
  - pointer
    - Only meaningful in address space
  - Solution
    - no pointer usage
    - copy entire pointed data
    - only suitable for bounded and known areas
- Communication error
  - duplicate or missing calls
    - RPC may fail or duplicate execution duto to network problem
  - Solution
    - At most once
      - attach timestamp or sequence number to each message
      - server must keep a history large enough to ensure repeated message
    - Exact once
      - server must acknowledge to client RPC call received & executed
      - client must resend each RPC call periodically unitl server receives ACK
