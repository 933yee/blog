### What is an Operating System?
- An operating system is the **permanent** software that **controls/ abstracts** **hardware resources** for user applications
- build a virtual machine interface
- 把底層的 hardware 抽象化，變成一堆 API，讓使用者用

#### Computer System
  - Hardware
    - provides basic **computing resources** (CPU, memory, I/O devices)
  - Operating System
    - **controls** and **coordinates**
      - controls: 控制 CPU
      - coordinates: 多人分配資源
    - the use of the **hardware/ resources**
  - Application
    - define the ways in which the system resources are used to **solve the computing problems**
  - User
    - people, machines, other computers

#### Multi-tasking Operating Systems
- Manages resources and processes to support different user applications
  - Loading/unloading code, scheduling program execution
- Provides Applications Programming Interface (API) for user applications 
  - use of memory, I/O devices, storage, communication

#### General-Purpose Operating Systems
```img

```
- Device drivers
  - OS 的一部份
  - 驅動器，幫助作業系統和硬體設備（印表機、鍵盤、滑鼠...）做溝通
  - 獨立出 OS 的原因是 driver 可以不斷 install

#### Definition of an Operating System
```def
No universally accepted definition
```
##### Resource allocator
- **manages** and **allocates resources** to insure efficiency and fairness
  - CPU time, storage space, use of I/O devices
##### Control program
- **controls** the execution of user **programs** and operations of **I/O devices** to prevent errors and improper use of computer
##### Kernel
- the one program running at all times (all else being system/ application programs)
- OS 的別名

#### Boundary of OS
- Kernel - part of OS
  - the "core part" that is resident and governs OS functionality
- Boot Loader - not a part of OS
  - ROM code executed on power up, loads the OS into memory
  - Boot Loader 是開機載入程式，其主要功用是用來載入作業系統的核心
- System programs
  - program loaders - for OS to start running a program
  - Interpreters: CLI shell, GUI, Java
  - Compilier and linker, Device driver, library
- Middleware - layer crossing the network
  - web browser
  - Database, multimedia, cloud drive, location service

#### Goals of a Operating System
- Convenience
  - make computer system easy to use and compute 
  - In particular for small PC
- Efficiency
  - use computer hardware in an efficient manner
  - Especially for large, shared, multiuser systems
- Two goals are sometimes **contradictory**
- In the past, efficiency is more important 

#### Importance of a Operation System
- Systems API are the **only** interface between use applications and hardware
  - API are designed for general-purpose, not performance driven 
- OS code cannot allow any bug
  - Any break (e.g. invalid access) causes reboot
- The owner of OS technology **controls** the software & hardware industry
- Operating Systems and Computer Architecture influence each other

#### Modern Operating Systems
- x86 platform
  - Linux (CentOS, Redhat, openSUSE, Ubuntu, etc)
  - Windows (Windows10, XP, 2000, etc)
- PowerPC platform - Mac OS
- Smartphone Mobile OS
  - Android, iOS, Windows10 Mobile, Ubuntu Touch
- Embedded OS
  - Embedded Linux (Android, WebOS), Windows CE
  - Raspberry Pi, Xbox, etc

### Computer-Systems Organization
- One or more CPUs, device controllers connect through **common bus** providing access to **shared memory**
- Goals:
  - **Concurrent** execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles
- I/O 和 CPU 經由公用 Bus 存取共用 Memory
```img

```
#### Computer-System Operations
- Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type
- Each device controller has a local buffer
- 每個 I/O device 都有一個 controller 在負責控制
- **I/O is from the device to controller's local buffer**
- **CPU moves data** from/to memory to/from local buffers in device controllers
  - 主要是 CPU 控制 controller
- device 和 memory 速度差距太大，所以會需要 controller
```img

```
 
#### Interrupt I/O
- (Polling) Busy/wait is very inefficient
  - CPU can't do other work while testing device
  - Hard to do simultaneous I/O
- **Interrupts** allow a device to **change the flow of control in the CPU**
  - Causes subroutine call to handle device!
```img

```
- Modern **OS are interrupt driven**
- The occurence of an event is signaled by an interrupt from either hardware or software
  - **Hardware** may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending a **signal** to CPU
  - **Software** may trigger an interrupt either by an **error** (division by zero or invalid memory access) or by a user request for an operating system **service** (**system call**)
    - 為了保護系統，所有 system call 都要透過 interrupt
- Software interrupt also called **trap**

##### Hardware Interrupt
```img

```
- 裝 driver 時，會 overwrite service routine

##### Software Interrupt
```img
sw-interrupt.png
```
##### Common Functions of Interrupts
- Interrupt transfer control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the **Interrupt vector**, which contrains the **address** (function pointer) of all the **service (i.e. interrupt handler) routines**
- Interrupt architecture must save the **address** of the **interrupted instruction**
  - 才能 return
- Incoming interrupts are **disabled** while another interrupt is being processed to prevent a lost interrupt
  - 避免 interrupt 後跳到的地方又被 interrupt

### Storage-Device Hierarchy
- Storage systems organized in hierarchy
  - Speed, Cost, Volatility
- **Main Memory** - Only large storage media that **the CPU can access directly**
- Secondary storage - extension of main memory that provides **large nonvolatile storage** capacity 
  - Magnetic disk
```img

```
#### Disk Mechanism
- Speed of magnetic disk
  - Transfer time = `latex \frac{data szie}{transfer time} `
  - Positioning time 
    - seek time (cylinder) + rational latency (sector)

#### Caching  
- Information in use **copied** from **slower** to **faster** storage temporarily
- Faster storage (cache) checked first to determine if information is there
  - If it is, information used directly from the cache (fast)
  - If not, data copied to cache and used there
  
##### Coherency and Consistency Issue
- The same data may appear in different levels
  - Change the **copy in register** make it inconsistent with other copies
- Single task accessing
  - No problem, always use the **Highest level** copy
- Multi-task accessing
  - Need to obtain the most recent value
- Distributed system
  - Difficult because copies are on different computers

### Hardware Protection
#### Dual-Mode operation
- What is protect?
  - Sharing system resources requires OS to ensure that an incorrect program cannot cause **other programs** to execute incorrectly
- Provide **hardware support** to differentiate between at least two modes of operations
  1. **User mode** - execution done on behalf of a user
  2. **Monitor mode** (also **kernel mode** or system mode) - execution done on behalf of **operation system**
    - system call
- Mode bit added to computer hardware to indicate the current mode: kernel(0) or user(1)
- When an interrupt/trap or fault occurs, hardware switches to monitor mode
```img

```
- **Privileged instructions**
  - Executed only in **Monitor mode**
  - Requested by users (system calls)
#### I/O protection
- All I/O instructions are priviliged instructions
  - Any I/O device is shared between users
- Must ensure that a user program could never gain control of the computer in monitor mode (i.e., a user program that, as part of its execution, stores a **new address** in the interrupt vector)
#### Memory protection
- Protect
  - Interrupt vector and the interrupt service routine
  - Data access and overwrite from other programs
- Hardware support: two registers for legal address derermination (also be protected)
  - **Base register** - holds the smallest legal physical memory address
  - **Limit register** - contains the size of the range
- Memory outside the defined range is protected
#### CPU protection
- Prevent user program from not returning control
  - prevent stuck in an infinite loop
    - ex: 寫了無窮迴圈還能做其他操作，像是鍵盤、滑鼠
  - not calling system services
- Hardware support: **Timer** - interrupts computer after specified period
  - Tiemr is decremented every clock tick
  - When timer reaches the value of 0, an interrupt occurs
- Timer commonly used to implement **time sharing**
- **Load-Timer** is a priviliged instruction
