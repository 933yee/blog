### What is an Operating System?
- An operating system is the **permanent** software that **controls/ abstracts** **hardware resources** for user applications
- build a virtual machine interface
- 把底層的 hardware 抽象化，變成一堆 API，讓使用者用

#### Computer System
  - Hardware
    - provides basic **computing resources** (CPU, memory, I/O devices)
  - Operating System
    - **controls** and **coordinates**
      - controls: 控制 CPU
      - coordinates: 多人分配資源
    - the use of the **hardware/ resources**
  - Application
    - define the ways in which the system resources are used to **solve the computing problems**
  - User
    - people, machines, other computers

#### Multi-tasking Operating Systems
- Manages resources and processes to support different user applications
- Provides Applications Programming Interface (API) for user applications 

#### General-Purpose Operating Systems

```
- Device drivers
  - OS 的一部份
  - 驅動器，幫助作業系統和硬體設備（印表機、鍵盤、滑鼠...）做溝通
  - 獨立出 OS 的原因是 driver 可以不斷 install

#### Definition of an Operating System
```def
No universally accepted definition
```
##### Resource allocator
- **manages** and **allocates resources** to insure efficiency and fairness
##### Control program
- **controls** the execution of user **programs** and operations of **I/O devices** to prevent errors and improper use of computer
##### Kernel
- the one program running at all times (all else being system/ application programs)
- OS 的別名

#### Goals of a Operating System
- Convenience
  - make computer system easy to use and compute 
  - In particular for small PC
- Efficiency
  - use computer hardware in an efficient manner
  - Especially for large, shared, multiuser systems
- Two goals are sometimes **contradictory**
- In the past, efficiency is more important 

#### Importance of a Operation System
- Systems API are the **only** interface between use applications and hardware
  - API are designed for general-purpose, not performance driven 
- OS code cannot allow any bug
  - Any break (e.g. invalid access) causes reboot
- The owner of OS technology **controls** the software & hardware industry
- Operating systems and computer architecture influence each other

#### Modern Operating Systems
- x86 platform
  - Linux (CentOS, Redhat, openSUSE, Ubuntu, etc)
  - Windows (Windows10, XP, 2000, etc)
- PowerPC platform - Mac OS
- Smartphone Mobile OS
  - Android, iOS, Windows10 Mobile, Ubuntu Touch
- Embedded OS
  - Embedded Linux (Android, WebOS), Windows CE
  - Raspberry Pi, Xbox, etc

### Computer-Systems Organization
- One or more CPUs, device controllers connect through **common bus** providing access to **shared memory**
- Goals:
  - **Concurrent** execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles
- I/O 和 CPU 經由公用 Bus 存取共用 Memory

#### Computer-System Operations
- Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type
- Each device controller has a local buffer
- 每個 I/O device 都有一個 controller 在負責控制，同時擁有 local buffer
- **I/O is from the device to controller's local buffer**
- **CPU moves data** from/to memory to/from local buffers in device controllers
- I/O 和 CPU 可以同時在運作
- device controller 需要專屬軟體來指揮它們，這些軟體叫做驅動程式 (device driver)
    - 驅動程式對 controller 下命令指揮它們完成輸出入工作
- OS 透過 driver 來控制與指揮 device controller 對週邊設備做實際的 I/O 動作
- device controller 利用中斷 (inperrupt) 來通知 CPU，他做好 I/O 了
- Should device controller be consider as a CPU?
  - Many I/O device even have powerful microprocessor
