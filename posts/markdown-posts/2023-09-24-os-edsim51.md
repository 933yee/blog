### EdSim51 DI = Dynamic Interface
- Simulates a complete embedded system
- LCD, LEDs, keypad, bank of buttons, ADC, DAC
- cycle-accurate processor

### EdSim51 SH
- Customize the devices to use


### Example
```
ORG 0000H
MOV 90H, #24H
END
```
- ORG: start your instruction at a different address
- MOV: move constant **24 (hex)** into the register address **90 (hex)**
- seven segment display
  - 0 is a pull-down, turns on
  - 1 is leaves it as pull-up, turns off LED
- **END** in assembly
  - END is an **assembly directive**
  - it just means end of source code listing
  - it does not mean CPU stops running

### Processor in EdSim51
- 8-bit words
  - its registers are 8-bits
- 16-bit address (external), 8-bit address (internal)
- Harvard architecture
  - 64KB **external** data memory, 256-byte **internal** memory
  - seperate 64KB code memory

### Block diagram of 8051
```img

```
- OSC (oscillator)
  - generate clock frequency
- Serial port
  - uars, universal asynchronous receiver transmitter
  - TxD
    - Transmit data
  - RxD
    - Receive data
  - TxD and RxD are independent, full duplex

### Memory Spaces in 8051
```img

```
- IDATA
  - 128 bytes that you get to use
  - 128 bytes are reserved for special function registers
- XDATA
  - not supported

### Registers in 8051
- General purpose, 8-bit
  - A: (Accumlator), B
  - R0, R1, ..., R7 (CPU registers, in 4 banks)
- 16-bit, specially used as pointers
  - DPTR: data pointer, concatenated DPH, DPL
  - PC: (program counter) not user visible
- PSW: program status word (8-bit)

### Banks of CPU Registers
- One set of 8 registers visible at a time
  - R0, ...R7 -> selected using 3 bits
- Four banks of CPU registers, in IDATA
  - bank 0: IDATA addresses 0x00 - 0x07
  - bank 1: IDATA addresses 0x08 - 0x0F
  - bank 2: IDATA addresses 0x10 - 0x17
  - bank 3: IDATA addresses 0x18 - 0x1F
  - bank selected by setting a special function register

### Accumulator (A)
- An implicit register in many instructions
  - as both a source and the destination
  - e.g. ADD A, #23 meaning A = A + 23
- Reason for using A
  - small code size, because there is just one
  - All others require several bits for registers

### 8051 ISA: Four I/O ports
- 8-bits each
  - P0, P1, P2, P3
- Direct addresses
  - 80H, 90H, A0H, B0H
- Difference
  - values tied to the pins
- Bit addressable
