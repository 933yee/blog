### OS services
- User interface
- Program Execution
- I/O operations
- File-system manipulation
- Communication
  - 不同電腦的 network 溝通
  - 同一台電腦 process 之間的溝通
- Error detection
- Resource allocation
- Accounting
- Protection and security

#### User interface
- CLI (Command Line Interface)
  - Fetches a command from user and executes it
  - **Shell: Command-line interpreter** (CSHELL, BASH)
    - Adjusted according to user behavior and preference
    - ex: 有些人喜歡 ls，有些人喜歡 dir、字體顏色
- GUI (Graphic User Interface)
  - Usually mouse, keyboard, and monitor
  - Icons represent files, programs, actions, etc
  - Various mouse buttons over objects in the interface cause various actions
- Most systems hav both **CLI** and **GUI**

### Communication Models
- Communication may take place using either **message passing** or **shared memory**
- message passing
  - 因為 protection，需要透過 OS 來 copy，會比較慢
- shared memory
  - 透過 system call，建立 shared memory
  - multi-thread programming 一開始就有 shared memory
  - deadlock synchronization

### OS-Application Interface
#### Basic Introduction
- System calls
  - The **OS interface** to a running program
  - An explicit request to the **kernel** made via a **software interface**
  - Generally available as **assembly-language** instructions
- API
  - **Users mostly program against API instead of system call**
  - Commonly implemented by language libraries, e.g., **C Library**
  - An API call should involve **zero or multiple system call**
    - Both malloc() and free() use system call brk()
    - Math API functions, such as abs(), don't need to involve system call

```
#### System calls
- Request OS services
  - Process control
    - abort, create, terminate process, allocate/free memory
  - File management
    - create, delete, open, close file
  - Device management
    - read, write, reposition device
  - Information maintenance
    - get time or date
  - Communications
    - send receive message
- **Three general methods** are used to pass parameters between a running program and the operating system  
  - pass parameters in **registers**
  - store the parameters in a **table in memory**, and the table address is passed as a parameter in a register
    - pointer of data structure 
  - Push (store) the parameters onto the **stack** by the program and pop off the stack by operating system
#### API
- Three most common APIs
  - **Win32 API** for **windows**
  - **POSIX API** for POSIX-based systems (including virtually all versions of UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS X)
    - POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for Unix)
    - system calls 不一樣，但是 API 的定義一樣，確保同個程式碼可以在不同作業系統運行，所以叫做 portable
  - **Java API** for the java virtual machine (JVM)
    - run 在自己虛擬的 virtual machine 上，不管下面真實的 machine 是什麼，probability 更好
    - 比較慢
- Features
  - Simplicity
    - API is designed for applications
  - Portability
    - API is an unified defined interface
  - **Efficiency**
    - Not all functions require OS services or involve kernel
  
### System Structure
- User goals 
  - operating system should be **easy to use** and **learn**, as well as reliable, safe and fast
- System goals
  - operating system should be **easy to design**, **implement** and **maintain**, as well as **reliable**, **error-free**, and **efficient**

#### Simple OS Architecture
- Only one or two levels of code
- Drawbacks
  - Unsafe, difficult to enhance
#### Layer OS Architecture
- Lower levels independent of upper levels
  - Nth layer can only access services provided by 0 ~ (N-1)th layer
- Pros
  - Easier debugging/maintenance
- Cons
  - Less efficiency, difficult to define layers
    - layer 之間會需要很多 copy
#### Microkernel OS
- Moves as much from the kernel into **user space**
- Communication is provided by **message passing**
- Easier for extending and poring
#### Modular OS Structure
- no need **message passing**
- Most modern OS implement **kernel modules**
  - Uses **object-oriented approach**
  - Each core **component is seperate**
  - Each talks to the others over **known interfaces**
  - Each is **loadable** as needed within the kernel
- Similar to layers but with more flexible
#### Virtual Machine
#### Java Virtual Machine
