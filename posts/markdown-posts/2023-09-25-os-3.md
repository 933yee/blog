### OS services
- User interface
  - CLI, GUI, Batch
- Program Execution
  - loader loads a program into memory to run
  - program ends execution, either normally or abnormally (indicating error) - gives control back to OS
- I/O operations
  - file or I/O device
- File-system manipulation
  - 不是所有系統都需要 file system， ex: embedded system
  - read, write, create delete files and directories
  - search them, list file info, manage permission
- Communication
  - between processes on same host, or between hosts over network
    - 不同電腦的 network 溝通
    - 同一台電腦 process 之間的溝通
    - shared memory vs message passing
- Error detection
  - CPU and memory hardware, I/O devices, user program
  - Debugging facilities
- Resource allocation
  - 確保電腦不會被某支程式拖累
  - for multiple users or multiple jobs running concurrently
  - including CPU cycles, main memory, file storage, I/O devices
- Accounting
  - keep track of which users use how much and what kinds of computer resources
- Protection and security
  - Protection: ensuring all access to system resources is controlled
  - Security: user authentication, defending external I/O devices from invalid access attempts

#### User interface
- CLI (Command Line Interface)
  - Fetches a command from user and executes it
  - **Shell: Command-line interpreter** (CSHELL, BASH)
    - Adjusted according to user behavior and preference
    - ex: 有些人喜歡 ls，有些人喜歡 dir、字體顏色
- GUI (Graphic User Interface)
  - Usually mouse, keyboard, display, now touch screen
  - Icons represent files, programs, actions, etc
  - Various mouse buttons over objects in the interface cause various actions
- Others
  - Gestured-based, Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), Voice (Siri)
- Most systems have both **CLI** and **GUI**

##### Two approaches to shell
- Shell that understands all commands
  - self-containted, bigger shell, but efficient per command
  - to add commands -> need to modify the shell
- Shell that invokes executable file
  - does not understand the command; only the syntax (e.g., command arg1 arg2 arg3...)
  - invokes executable corresponding to commnad
  - smaller shell, heavier weight per command
  - very expandable, no need to modify shell to add command
  
### Communication Models
- Communication may take place using either **message passing** or **shared memory**
- message passing
  - 因為 protection，需要透過 OS 來 copy (system call)
  - 會比較慢
- shared memory
  - 透過 system call，事前建立 shared memory，預設是沒有的
  - multi-thread programming 一開始就有 shared memory
  - deadlock synchronization

```
### OS-Application Interface
#### Basic Introduction
- System calls
  - The **OS interface** to a running program
    - part of OS
  - An explicit request to the **kernel** mode via a **software interface**
  - Generally available as **assembly-language** instructions
    - 才夠快
- API
  - **Users mostly program against API instead of system call**
  - Commonly implemented by language libraries, e.g., **C Library**
    - 大部分作業系統 API 是用 C
    - Android 是 Java
  - An API call should involve **zero or multiple system call**
    - Both malloc() and free() use system call brk()
    - fopen() 要很多 system call 
    - Math API functions, such as abs(), don't need to involve system call
```img

```
#### System calls
- Request OS services
  - Process control
    - abort, create, terminate process, allocate/free memory
    - get and set process attributes
    - wait for time, event, signal event
    - error dump, single-step for debug
    - locks for shared data
  - Protection
    - get and set permissions, allow and deny user access
  - File management
    - create, delete, open, close file
    - get and set file attributes
  - Device management
    - request, release device attach, detach devices
    - read, write, reposition device
    - get device attributes, set device attributes
  - Information maintenance
    - get/set time, date, get/set system data
    - get/set process, file, or device attributes
  - Communications
    - create, delete communication connection
    - (Message passing) send, receive messages
    - (Shared memory) create and gain access to memory regions
    - transfer status information
    - attach and detach remote devices
- **Three general methods** are used to pass parameters between a running program and the operating system  
  - pass parameters in **registers**
  - store the parameters in a **table in memory**, and the table address is passed as a parameter in a register
    - pointer of data structure 
  - Push (store) the parameters onto the **stack** by the program and pop off the stack by operating system

##### Example process control on FreeBSD
- Unix variant, multitasking
- User login
  - invoke user's choice of shell: bash, tcsh, ksh...
- Shell executes fork() to create process
  - exec() to load program into process
    - replace the created process
  - Shell waits for process to terminate or continues with user commands
- Process exits with
  - code = 0, no eroor
  - code > 0, error code

#### API
- Three most common APIs
  - **Win32 API** for **Windows**
  - **POSIX API** for POSIX-based systems (including virtually all versions of UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS)
    - POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for Unix)
    - system calls 不一樣，但是 API 的定義一樣，確保同個程式碼可以在不同作業系統運行，所以叫做 portable
  - **Java API** for the Java virtual machine (JVM)
    - run 在自己虛擬的 virtual machine 上，不管下面真實的 machine 是什麼，probability 更好
    - 比較慢
- Features
  - Simplicity
    - API is designed for applications
  - Portability
    - API is an unified defined interface
  - **Efficiency**
    - Not all functions require OS services or involve kernel
    - 幫你寫好最有效率的底層語言
  
#### Run-Time Environment (RTE)
- suite of software to run application
  - for applications written in specific language (or at least particular calling convention)
  - could include compilier, linker, interpreter, library, loader
- RTE support for system calls
  - maintains system-call numbers, provides calling interface


#### System Programs (system sevices, system utilities)
- A layer of programs above system calls, for purpose of  
  - Convenient for program development and execution
  - Define most users' view of OS
- Categories
  - File manipulation, Status information
  - Programming language support, loading and execution
  - Communications
  - Background services
  - Application programs
##### File management
- Create delete, copy, rename, print, dump, list and generally manipulate files and directories
##### Status information
- Get date, time, availalbe memory, disk space, number of users
- Performance, logging, and debugging information
- Registry for configuration information
##### File search and edit
- Text editors (vim), search contents, tranform text
- not system calls
##### Programming-language support, loading, execution
- Compilers assemblers, debuggers (gdb) and interpreters (python)
- Absolute loaders, relocatable loaders, linkage editors and overlay-lodares, debugging systems for higer-level and machine language
##### Communication
- Creating connections among processes, users
  - Interprocess vs. Network communication
- examples:
  - send messages, browse web pages, send email, remote login, FTP
- Main Models of communication
  - message-passing vs. shared-memory
##### Background Services
- Launch at boot time
  - Some for system startup, then terminate
  - Some from system boot to shutdown
- Disk checking, process scheduling, error logging, printing

##### (bundled) Application programs
- Not typically considered part of OS
- Launched by command line, mouse click, finger poke

#### Application Binary Interface (ABI)
- definition for executable program
  - executable file format (ELF, COFF, Mach-O, EXE, PE)
  - ISA of the program code (native, bytecode, etc); could be "fat binary"
  - parameter passing convention (stack, register, ...)
  - data types (sizes, endian)
- Tools involved
  - linker
    - resolves addresses of all symbols
  - loader
    - loads linked image into memory to execute


### System Structure
- User goals 
  - operating system should be **easy to use** and **learn**, as well as **reliable**, **safe** and **fast**
    - interactive 的 fast (time-sharing)
- System goals
  - operating system should be **easy to design**, **implement** and **maintain**, as well as **reliable**, **error-free**, and **efficient**

#### Separation of Policy and Mechanism in OS design
- Policy
  - What will be done? What is allowed? (parameterizable)
- Mechanism
  - How to do it? (implementation)
- Important principle
  - it allows maximum **flexibility** if policy decisions are to be changed later (example - timer)
  - not always so separated in commercial OS but desirable as good practice of OS design


#### Simple OS Architecture
- Only one or two levels of code
- Uses the least space
- Minimal structure
  - Not divided into modules
  - interfaces and levels of functionality are not well seperated
- Drawbacks
  - Unsafe, difficult to enhance
```img

```

##### Example: MS-DOS
- single-tasking
- shell invoked on booting
- simple way to run program
  - no process created
  - single memory space
  - loads program into memory, overwritting all but the kernel
- Program exit -> shell reloaded

```img
MS-DOS.png
```

#### Monolithic Structure
- monolithic 是指整體的，也就是 OS 是一個龐大的東西，全部擠在一起
- shared memory
- Two layers
  - users mode vs. kernel mode
  - the entire OS kernel runs in one address space
  - tightly coupled large number functions for one level
  - 如果 user mode 那裡 crash，不會影像 kernel mode 的 OS
  - 如果 OS 裡面有 bug 還是會 crash
- Exmaples
  - traditional Unix (difficult to scale complexity)
  - Linux (monolithic for performance but modular)
  - Windows (also monolithic but got more modular)

#### Layer OS Architecture
- Lower levels independent of upper levels
  - Nth layer can only access services provided by 0 ~ (N-1)th layer
- Pros
  - Easier debugging / maintenance
  - higher level crash 不會影響 lower level
- Cons
  - Less efficiency, difficult to define layers
    - layer 之間會需要很多 copy
```img
layer-os-architecture.png
```

#### Microkernel OS
- 不想要部分 OS crash 影響到其他部分的 OS
- kernel 的程式碼越少越好，更 reliable
- Moves as much from the kernel into **user space**
  - 是 kernel defined user，OS 以外的不能直接 access
- Communication is provided by **message passing**
  - modularize 的概念，kernel 只負責溝通
- Easier for extending and poring
- 效能更差，因為需要大量 system call、memory copy
```img
microkernel-os.png
```

#### Modular OS Structure
- no need **message passing**
- support **loadable kernel modules (LKM)**
  - kernel = core components + LKM interfaces
  - LKM is loaded as needed, can be un loaded (e.g., USB driver)
- Combine advantages of microkernel and layered
- Most modern OS implement **kernel modules**
  - Uses **object-oriented approach**
  - Each core **component is seperate**
  - Each talks to the others over **known interfaces**
  - Each is **loadable** as needed within the kernel
- Similar to layers but with more flexible
```img
modular-os-structure.png
```
#### Hybrid Systems
- Most modern OSs are some mix of models 
  - hybrid to address performance, security, usability needs

#### Operating-System Debugging
- Failure analysis: Finding and fixing errors
  - User program crash
    - log files error info
    - **core dump** file captures memory of the process
  - OS failure
    - can generate **crash dump** file containing kernel memory
- Performance monitoring and tuning
  - using trace listings of activities, recorded for analysis
  - profiling = instruction trace for statitical trends


#### Virtual Machine
- A virtual machine takes the **layered** approach to its logical conclusion
  - It treats hardware and the **operating system** kernel as though they were all hardware
- A virtual machine provides an interface **identical to the underlying bare hardware**
  - Each process is provided with a (virtual) copy of the underlying computer
- Difficult to achieve due to **critical instruction**
- critical instruction
  - User space 的執行結果和 Kernel space 的執行結果不一樣
```img
VM.png
```
- Usage
  - provides complete protection of system resources
    - 不同使用者共用一台電腦不會互相影響
  - a mean to solve system compatibility problems
    - 環境問題
  - a perfect vehicle for operating-systems research and development
    - kernel 有 bug 會整個 crash 掉，VM 適合用來測試
  - honeypot
  - a mean to increase resources utilization in **cloud computing**
    - 不過 cloud computing 不一定要 VM

##### Vmware (Full Virtualization)
- Run in **user** mode as an application on top of OS
- Virtual machine believe they are running on bare hardware but **in fact are running inside a user-level application**
- Guest OS 的程式碼不用動
```img
VMware.png
```

##### Para-virtualization: Xen
- Presents guest with system **similar but not identical** to the guest's preffered systems (**Guest must be modified**)
- 有 global manager(master)，可能會比較快，但是 overhead 比較高
```img
Xen.png
```

#### Java Virtual Machine
- Compiled Java programs are **platform-neutral bytecodes** executed by a **Java Virtual Machine** (JVM)
- JVM consists of
  - class loader
  - class verifier
  - runtime interpreter
- **Just-In-Time** (JIT) compilers increase performance
  - reuse 翻譯過的程式碼
