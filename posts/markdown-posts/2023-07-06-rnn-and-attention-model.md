## Reccurent Neural Networks (RNN) Basics
```citation
More opportunity to play around with inputs and outputs
```
- one to many
- many to one
- many to many
- sequence to sequence

<br>

### Sequential Precessing of Non-Sequence Data
- Classify images by taking a series of **glimpses**.
- Generate images one piece at a time.

<br>

### Truncated Backpropagation through time

<br>

### Multt-layered RNN

<br>

### Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

## Transformer Structrue
- Input Embedding
- Postional Encoding
- Multi-Headed Attention 
  - Query, Key, Value
  - Scale
  - SoftMax
- Residual Connection, Layer
